- map starting locations
- PF starting distribution other than random
- PF shortcut through center
- use Ricker's map
- dynamic resampler based on error (measured versus modelled sense of best guess)
  - error increasing -> more particles
  - error decreasing -> less particles

-----

x weighted guess
