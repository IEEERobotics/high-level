"""Primary module of navigation package. 

As this develops, it will eventually accept a goalPose from planner, request a currentPose from localizer, then call
SBPL code (C++ made usable in Python by some method) and pass the configuration params. No file will be created and
no subprocess will spawn. The solution generated by SBPL will be returned to nav (not written to a file), and will then
be parsed and handed off to comm. Some additional logic involving issuing steps of the solution to comm, getting results,
checking for the amount of error, notifying localizer, maybe re-planning, and then issuing the next step will need to
be added."""
